# pickler: just enough pickle for graphite

## Installation

To install pickler, add the following dependency to your `project.clj`
file:

```
[org.spootnik/pickler "0.1.0"]
```

## Usage

A simple namespace which exposes twos functions `raw->ast` and
`ast->metrics`

* `raw->ast`: generates an AST for pickle data from a bytebuffer, the
  AST is just a list of maps containing at least a `:type` key storing
  the pickle opcode.
* `ast->metrics`: generates a list of graphite metrics from an AST,
  the list is a list of 3-tuples containing, the metric timestamp and
  name of the datapoint
